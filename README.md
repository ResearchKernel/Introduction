#### A Platform to the Researchers, for the Researchers and by the Researchers.  

The objective of this _open source project_ is to provide a platform for searching research paper available on arxiv as of now and give recommendations based on the interaction with the platform, Personalised recommendation of research papers and notify the user only about which recent paper is relevant based on what have you searh and interaction on this platform    

## Our Future 

We're not sure if this project is going to make any difference in the research world. However, we're taking our chances and second of all we love anything related to research and development irrespective of the field. 

If somehow this project does make it to the market and get a stable point and we are able to get some donations then our next focus is to implement the research papers mostly focused on renewable energy, computer science and physics related topics.


## Ideas for this project

1. Smart Search Engine
2. Personalised Recommendation System
3. Content based Recommendation System
4. Discource Community
5. Personalized Updates 
6. Personal Libray

## Project Sections and Structure

Sections | Description
---------|----------
Web Development | Our project manifestor
Data Science | We use machine learning and deep learning for building Personalised and content based recommendation systems
Cloud Platform | We prefered AWS Cloud for our Development, Stagging, Production environments because it's easy to use and fit perfect for our project  

### Web Development

As the name suggest we build the FrontEnd and BackEnd of our website for this project. For BackEnd we use node.js and for FrontEnd we use react.js. For Database we use MySQL(or Maybe AuroraDB by AWS) and Neo4j graph Database. 

### Data Science

We are not bound by any language or Library in data science, but as of now we use python as language and multiple Libraries(NLTK, Spacy, Gensim, Pytorch) for implement NLP, recommendation systems tasks.  For Distribiting ML systems we use SparkML, and Tensorflow.  
 
### Cloud 

We are currently using AWS Cloud Platform for development, staging and Production workloads. From Automated Deployemnt Prespected we are thinkinf of using Jenkins, Kubernetes and docker for containers. 
 

# We are working on...
1. Content Based Paper Recommendation System
2. Smart Search Engine
3. Paper Discussion Board
4. User Library 
6. Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins 
7. AWS platform Website Architecture
8. Website FrontEnd in react.js using ant-design
9. API Development for recommendation systems in production 
10. Arxiv metadata Database Syncing to development and production environments
